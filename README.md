[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0ceb158c-3283-414f-9371-029a8e22d50e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/niceguysfinishlast/deploys)

This is my minimalistic blog based on gatsby starter template and Dan Abramov's [blog](https://overreacted.io).

Feel free to fork it, and make it better.

This is the live [site](https://niceguysfinishlast.dev)

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd blog182/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `blog182` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
